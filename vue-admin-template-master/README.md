## How to push a new branch to a repository

### 1.build a new branch in ur computer
> in this stage, when you switch another branch, u need to git's command(add, commit) to preserve and update ur branch.

* `git checkout -b newBranchName`
* add some files u need to push
* delete some files u no longer need in this branch
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "some info"
* `git push origin newBranchName`

when u finish the last step, the github will create a new branch in your repository.

> Tips: the GitHub will not compute contribution if the branch is not the master in repository.
